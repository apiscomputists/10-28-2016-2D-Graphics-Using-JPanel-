# 10-25-2016-2D-Graphics-Using-JPanel-

2 weeks before, our team has worked on coding "area calculators" of geometric shapes. That is the mathematical side of shapes in computers. This time, we have attempted to work with shapes in a visual manner; we have created a code that VISUALIZES shapes using JPanel. 

- We plan on playing around with JPanel until the end of October.
